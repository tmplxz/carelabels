# CERTIFICATION SUITE FOR MACHINE LEARNING CARE LABELS

**CODE WILL BE ADDED IN THE WEEK AFTER EASTER** 

This is a prototype certification suite, which generates **Care Labels** for trustworthy and resource-aware machine learning.
It is closely related to research work which is currently reviewed for ECML 2021, where we explain the concepts of our certification suite in detail.
**This is only a blinded preview for paper reviewers**, upon acceptance we will transfer this repository to the authors' GitHub.
